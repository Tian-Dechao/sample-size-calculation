Sample size justification: If the expected concordance for methylome is 90%, 10 patients will provide a 95% CI of (68%, 99%) using an exact binomial test. The 95% CI will be (26%, 88%) if the concordance is reduced to 60%. In this study, we will examine 20 patients at up to 4 time points. The sample size will be sufficient to detect sites that are differentially methylated in at least one time point. The methylation levels of a site over 4 time points are compared by linear mixed-effect model with random intercept for patients. Power analysis is conducted by simulation for a wide range of significant level alpha. The simulation results show that 20 samples will have strong power to detect sites that are differentially methylated in at least one time point. The sample size is also sufficient for multiple comparisons. For example, with 4 time points, when there are 1000 sites with a mean difference in methylation at 0.3, the power is 0.99 with the conservative Bonferroni correction.
