We will use the output from ChromHMM to identify regions with
differential chromatin states. Although the 11 histone marks together
with CTCF ChIP-seq data will give us as many as 25 different states
from ChromHMM 97, we propose to focus on seven different states,
including strong enhancer, weak enhancer, active promoter, weak/poised
promoter, insulator, transcribed regions, and other regions.
Chi-square test can be used to calculate sample size and perform power
analysis. However, there is limited literature on relevant studies
regarding effect size on chromatin state variation. Here we are
interested in the genomic loci with clear change in chromatin states.
We therefore expect that the effect size to be large and set to 0.8.
We set significant level alpha to 0.05 and power to 0.95. The degree
of freedom is 6. As a result, 34 samples in total and 17 samples in
each group are sufficient. The sample size is also sufficient for
multiple comparisons. For instance, when there are 100 loci with
effect size 0.8, the power is 61.1% with conservative Bonferroni
correction. The power is 39.6% when there are 1000 such loci. As
listed in the sample plan, we will be able to secure 30 pairs of
schizophrenia/control postmortem brain samples and have more than
enough samples for testing.
