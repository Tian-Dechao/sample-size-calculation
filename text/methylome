patient experiments (on testing methylomes of Circulating tumor cells). 
They want to know the number of patient samples needed to generate enough power in the case of differentiating CTC samples collected at 3-4 time points during therapy for patients. 
They are thinking about having 20 patients.

The purpose 'differentiating CTC samples collected at 3-4 time points' is addressed by finding genomic site or loci with gradually increased/decreased methylation levels over time points.
The score can also be the sum/average score over the genome of a patient.

The design is Longitudinal Research; could use repeated measures by ANOVA. 
    The score is not normally distributed. Try a non-prarmatric version. 
    KW test needs independence thus not working
    Repeated measures ANOVA
    Non-parametric version of Repeated measures ANOVA
    Multilevel models (MLM) includes mixture models and random effect models
    Simulation
To accont for correlations in methylation level of the same patient over the time points.
power methods developed for multivariate models provide the best available power analysis
The methylation value is non-Gaussian, such as bimodal distribution
Adjusting potential confounding variables
Effective size is a key parameter. First try 0.1 and the values that can get 20 samples.
Draw a figure for multiple effective size
