Our setting is repeated measures 
linear mixed-effect model.
controling within-subject random effect.
Frideman test (repeated measure ANOVA) and linear mixed-effect model are expected to ahieve similar results in our experimental setting (one group, 4 repeated measures).
Indeed, we found that 20 patients achieve similar power using linear mixed-effect model with randon intercept for patients.
Linear mixed-effect model is more powerful than repeated measure ANOVA (Frideman) but we expect the difference to be small. 
Indeed, we found 
20 patients achieve higher power
